At immigration they said LoC laga hua hai sir - EOW se check kar ke batate hai\n4. I found it strange as have travelled 4 times internationally since FIR filed in May - never been a problem and I had not even been summoned once\n5. Flight left in meantime anyways - EOW folks directed Immigration to let us out so that we can return home\n6. Today morning EOW summon was home delivered - will cooperate as always\nNo drama. LOC hatane ka process hai - I am not a flight risk - easy to prove hai.\nBaaki aapko jo chhaapna hai chhaapo.
